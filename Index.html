<img class="img_deg"  src="Shweta.png" alt="Shweta Dham" style="width:570px">
<p style="font-size:30px">My name is Shweta. I am a certified Coach from Cambridge University and a member of the Association for Coaching. I am an engineer and MBA by qualification, with over 14 years of experience across project management and organisational change management roles in multi-national firms. I am a firm believer in living a fulfilling life and having been through a number of transitions in my professional and personal life, I finally found my true calling. My passion is to empower people who are looking to make transitions in work or life by offering Personal Coaching/Career Coaching.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:30px">My coaching approach includes clarifying your goals, understanding your values and strengths and driving action/decisions. I tend to use positive psychology, person-centred coaching approaches. Having worked with people across the globe, I have special interest in supporting clients living/working in a cross-cultural environment.</p>
